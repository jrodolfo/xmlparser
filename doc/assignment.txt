Design and implement a XML parser to satisfy the following requirements:

1. Use sample-small.xml document for your assignment

2. There should be a configuration file where user can define the nodes
   (i.e ns2:Denomination) he/she is interested in (case insensitive)

3. During the passing the XML document, if it encounters one of a defined 
   tag, it should print the node value defined for that element as follows

		Node {Node name} found with value {Node value}

4. Application should be able to handle large files

5. Bonus: if the configuration file has defined the threshold file size 
   in bytes (e.g. FileThreshold:20000) then any xml file larger than that 
   will be considered to be a large file. In this case, your application
   should use appropriate parsing method to be able to handle large files.
 
General requirements:

	ZIP the source code including build, configuration source, and test codes.
	
	We should be able to compile build and run your application in house and 
	the implementation should follow the best practices of software development.

	It should include a release document explaining how to run your application 
	and explaining pre-requisites and configurations.
